    "    <p>I am a contradiction. I am passionate about technology and how much it's improved our lives and humanity in general. But I have a great fondness of the solitude of nature. I love being disconnected from everything. It's how I find balance. I have a romantic idea of living off the grid for a while and seeing what I find out about myself. My wife just smiles and nods.</p>\n" +
    "    <quote>Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean. - John Muir </quote>\n" +

    "    <quote>The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. - Christopher McCandless</quote>\n" +
