I love being disconnected from everything. It's how I find balance. I have a romantic idea of living off the grid for a while and seeing what I find out about myself. My wife just smiles and nods.</p>\n" +

    "    <quote>The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. - Christopher McCandless</quote>\n" +
